# Stacks and Queues Exercise

This repo is my solution to Springboard exercise 47.5.9. In this exercise I was tasked with implementing the main methods for the [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) and [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) abstract data types.

## Testing

First run:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, to run the tests for the stack exercise, type:

```bash
jest stack.test.js
```

To run the tests for the queue exercise, type:

```bash
jest queue.test.js
```
